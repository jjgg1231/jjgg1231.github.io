			<h2>Chris Browns Drops His New Album!</h2>
			<p>	
				Yes, thats right, Chris Brown has officially released his fourth studio album
				<em>F.A.M.E</em>.<br/><br/>
				The Album was released on March 18th, and is currently sitting at number six
				on the Album Charts. It features collaborations from some big names, including Justin Bieber,
				Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes and more.<br/><br/>
				<em>'Yeah 3x'</em>, <em>'Look At Me Now'</em>, and <em>'Beautiful People'</em> are the three 
				singles from the album so far, with <em>'She Ain't You'</em> becoming the fourth in the near
				future.<br/><br/>
				His third album, <em>Grafitti</em> recieved negative reviews from Critics and did not sell as
				well as his first two albums, most likely triggered by his conviction for assault in 2009. Will
				<em>F.A.M.E</em> flop too? We will have to wait and see.<br/><br/>
